# Game On! Community Guidelines

### [Code of Conduct][coc]
We've adopted a [Code of Conduct][coc] to encourage a supportive and accepting environment as the community grows.

### Creating New Channels
There are no limits for channel creation. Public channels and conversation are preferred!

### Pruning channels
Over time, channels can become quiet.  Any channel without regular activity can be nominated for removal. If and when a channel is deemed fit for archiving, we'll work with those who may wish to continue the discussion to find a new home.  We'll include some forwarding links in the channel and possibly use @channel to announce the move.

### `@everyone` `@channel`, or `@group`
Be judicious with use of `@everyone` `@channel`, or `@group`.
